## 🚀 Quick Start

Getting started with SuddenConnect is simple:

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HXQLabs/SuddenConnect.git
cd SuddenConnect
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend && npm install

# Frontend  
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### 3. **Configure environment variables**

```bash
# Backend: Copy and edit .env.example
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Frontend: Create .env.local
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001" > frontend/.env.local
```

### 4. **Start development servers**

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and allow camera/microphone access. 🎉

## 🛠️ Local Development

### Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is a Next.js application with App Router that manages device selection, user preferences, UI state, and the RTCPeerConnection lifecycle.

**Development commands:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start            # Start production server
```

**Environment variables:**

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

> **Note:** Frontend requires HTTPS in production for getUserMedia to function correctly. Device permissions must be granted by the user.

### Backend (Node.js + TypeScript)

The backend is a Node.js + TypeScript server providing Socket.IO signaling, user presence, and preference-based matchmaking.

**Development commands:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start            # Start production server
```

**Environment variables:**

Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=5001
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
# Optional: REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# Optional: STUN/TURN server configuration
```

> **Note:** Use a TURN server in production to ensure media relay when direct P2P is not possible. For multiple backend instances, configure Socket.IO Redis adapter.
